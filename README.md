Enigma Cryptographic Library in JavaScript
==========================================

This is to separate the cryptography library used by my `enigma` project and
make it more easy to maintain. The library will be then made into runable on
both browser and NodeJS.

Features included:

* Cryptography based on Elliptic Curves, this is however non-standard
  implementations.
* Symmetric cipher and Cascade Encryption.
* Hashing functions.
